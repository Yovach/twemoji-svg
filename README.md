# Twemoji SVG

I wanted to have Twitter's Twemoji emojis available as SVG files in a package as it was in the past, but I couldn't find any maintained package that provided that. Thereis a package called `@twemoji/svg` but it hasn't been updated in years and is missing many emojis.

You can use this package to get the latest Twemoji SVG files in a package that is regularly updated (a day after new Twemoji releases).

We are using the official Twemoji repository as the source for the SVG files (https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji).

## Installation

```bash
npm install twemoji-svg
```
or
```bash
yarn add twemoji-svg
```
